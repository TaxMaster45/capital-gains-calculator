    <h1>How to File Your US Taxes for Free in 2025: A Complete Guide</h1>
    
    <p>Every year, millions of Americans pay hundreds of dollars to file their taxes, not realizing they could have done it for <strong>absolutely free</strong>. Whether you are a student, a freelancer, or a W-2 employee, there are several IRS-approved ways to file without spending a dime.</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <strong>Quick Summary:</strong> If your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) is $79,000 or less, you qualify for the <strong>IRS Free File</strong> program, which gives you access to top-tier software like TaxAct and FreeTaxUSA for free.
    </div>

    <h2>1. The IRS Free File Program</h2>
    <p>The IRS partners with several private tax software companies to provide free federal tax preparation and e-filing. For 2025, the income limit is $79,000. This is the most secure way to file if you meet the income requirements.</p>

    <h2>2. Cash App Taxes (Formerly Credit Karma Taxes)</h2>
    <p>If you don't qualify for IRS Free File due to higher income, <strong>Cash App Taxes</strong> is one of the only truly free options that supports federal AND state returns for free, even for complex situations like stock sales or rental income.</p>

    <h2>3. Direct File (The New IRS Option)</h2>
    <p>In 2025, the IRS is expanding its own "Direct File" pilot program. This allows taxpayers in certain states with simple tax situations to file directly through the IRS website. It’s a game-changer for people who want to avoid private software companies altogether.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Don't leave money on the table. Before you pay $100+ for a "Deluxe" package, check if you qualify for the free options listed above. Filing early not only gives you peace of mind but also speeds up your refund process.</p>
