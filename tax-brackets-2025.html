    <h1>Federal Income Tax Brackets 2024-2025: A Complete Guide</h1>
    <p><em>Published: December 16, 2025 | Category: Tax Guide</em></p>

    <div class="info-box">
        <strong>Quick Summary:</strong> The US has a progressive tax system. This means as your income increases, you pay higher tax rates only on the money that falls into higher brackets, not on your total income.
    </div>

    <h2>What are Tax Brackets?</h2>
    <p>Federal income tax rates are divided into seven sections, known as brackets. For the 2024 and 2025 tax years, these rates are: 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37%.</p>
    <p>Many people misunderstand how brackets work. Being in the "22% bracket" doesn't mean you pay 22% on <em>all</em> your money. You only pay 22% on the portion of income that exceeds the limit of the 12% bracket.</p>

    <h2>2025 Tax Brackets (For Taxes Due April 2026)</h2>
    <p>The IRS adjusts these numbers annually for inflation. Here is the breakdown for Single Filers:</p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Tax Rate</th>
            <th>Taxable Income (Single)</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>10%</td>
            <td>$0 to $11,925</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>12%</td>
            <td>$11,926 to $48,475</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>22%</td>
            <td>$48,476 to $103,350</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>24%</td>
            <td>$103,351 to $197,300</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Standard Deduction</h2>
    <p>Before calculating your tax, don't forget to subtract the Standard Deduction. For 2025, the standard deduction for single filers has increased to <strong>$15,000</strong>.</p>
